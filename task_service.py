            Hi Hamish,
            Details of the project:
            A mouse pad with a built in screen for the user to display desktop background like images.
            The project is currently in concept phase, and some mock up designs are needed, can you please contact Vasco and
            ask him for technical details and then generate some designs. Send them to Vasco and myself.
            Thanks,
            Hamish.
